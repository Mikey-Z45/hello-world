Hello everyone,

  My name is Michael Divis and I am a CS major at Monterey Bay. This is my last year and I am excited to finally finish up with school and get my career going. At home I have 2 cats, one I got at the shelter and the other was a stray at my work. I love my cats, they are so loving and sweet. In my free time I like to play video games when I can, but I am usually at work or school since I do full time for both. I work as a chef and I can't wait to move on and get a job in a computerized field rather than working with food.
